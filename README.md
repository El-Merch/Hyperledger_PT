# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# Making better with docker

In the same way we also use docker for this repo, if you wanna check documentations there's all you need here [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

# Using Hyperledger

We make a submodule of [Hyperledger](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples.git) this to connect a simple React FrontEnd with a complex backend like Hyperledger with Express.
